----

This is FastAPI Boilerplate where to start when you start new
API or WS Projects for practical uses. It is highly recommended to see
[FastAPI Tutorial](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/) before starting
project with this boilerplate.

This boilerplate is based on poetry so you need to install packages through poetry
before trying to run this application. If you want to learn about poetry, check
out this [page](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

```
